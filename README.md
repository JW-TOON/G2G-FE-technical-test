## Project

Create a simple web application using VueJS (can be either with Vue 2 / 3) that is able to display a list of products. The products can be something of your own choice. E.g. Food, Electronics

The web app should achieve the following goals:
1) The list item for the product should be designed as a reusable component
2) We should be able to wishlist the products
3) We should be able to filter products by product name
4) We should be able to filter products by product category. There should be at least a minimum of 3 different categories
5) We should be able to sort products by lowest and highest price
6) We should be able to sort products by name ascending and descending

Candidates should put their work into github and set its access to be opened for the public.
The title of the repo should be set as G2G FE technical test


P.S. Candidates that have repos that cannot be accessed  / fail to run after compiling will automatically fail the technical test.
After the candidates complete their work, they should send their repo link to us via email with the title `G2G FE technical test (candidate name)`
