## Project

Create a simple web application using VueJS (can be either with Vue 2 / 3) that is able to display a list of products. The products can be something of your own choice. E.g. Food, Electronics

The web app should achieve the following goals:
1) The list item for the product should be designed as a reusable component
2) We should be able to wishlist the products
3) We should be able to filter products by product name
4) We should be able to filter products by product category. There should be at least a minimum of 3 different categories
5) We should be able to sort products by lowest and highest price
6) We should be able to sort products by name ascending and descending
